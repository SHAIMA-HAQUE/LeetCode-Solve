Improve  space complexity by:
y. We still have the min swck, but we only pop
from it when the value we pop from the main stack is equal to the one on the min stack. We only push to the min
stack when the va lue being pushed onto the ma in slack is less than or equal w the current min value. In this
modified algorithm also, if we wa nL to get lhc minimum th('n we just need to return the top clement from the
min slack.
